Renewlet is a self-hosted subscription ledger that reminds you before renewals. Add a subscription or any recurring charge, set its renewal date and reminder days, and it will notify you through the channels you configure. You can also track price, currency, budget, logo, category, and payment method.

Mobile web is first-class: open it in a phone browser to add subscriptions, filter lists, review stats, and configure notifications.

Idle memory usage is around 20-30MiB in local testing, making it comfortable for small VPS, NAS, and homelab boxes.

## Highlights

- Track each subscription clearly: name, logo, price, currency, billing cycle, renewal date, status, category, payment method, tags, website, and notes.
- Understand spending: normalize costs by month and year, then review budget usage, category breakdowns, payment-method charts, and inactive-subscription savings.
- Get renewal reminders: jobs are generated from each user's IANA time zone and local notification time, with reminder days, repeat reminders, delivery history, and failed-send retries.
- Send notifications through six channels: Telegram, Notifyx, Webhook, WeCom Bot, SMTP email, and Bark.
- Handle multiple currencies: choose Exchange API or FloatRates JSON Feeds, with fallback rates when remote providers are unavailable.
- Customize your lists: categories, payment methods, and currencies can be adjusted in settings, with built-in icons for common payment methods.
- Self-host one container: React frontend, Go/PocketBase backend, SQLite data, and static assets run together, with data persisted to `data/`.
- Deploy to Cloudflare Workers: React static assets, Worker API, D1, R2, and Cron Triggers can run without the Go/PocketBase server.
- Mobile-web friendly: bottom navigation, subscription cards, tag-filter drawers, and settings screens are adapted for small screens.
- Switch languages in the app: Simplified Chinese and English are supported.

## Cloudflare Workers Deploy

<a href="https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/zhiyingzzhou/renewlet"><img src="https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button" alt="Deploy to Cloudflare"></a>

[Cloudflare Workers Deploy](docs/cloudflare-workers-deploy.md)

## Quick Deploy

On a machine with Docker and Docker Compose v2:

```bash
mkdir -p renewlet && cd renewlet
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhiyingzzhou/renewlet/main/deploy/docker-deploy.sh | bash
docker compose up -d
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000/setup
```

Create the first admin user. The deploy script creates `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, and `data/`, then generates `PB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `CRON_SECRET` for you.

If Docker Hub is unavailable, switch the image in `.env` to GHCR:

```env
RENEWLET_IMAGE="ghcr.io/zhiyingzzhou/renewlet:latest"
```

Then pin a released version when you use Renewlet in production, pull, and restart:

```bash
sed -i.bak 's#RENEWLET_IMAGE=.*#RENEWLET_IMAGE="ghcr.io/zhiyingzzhou/renewlet:0.1.0"#' .env
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

`latest` only moves on stable GitHub Releases. For production, prefer a concrete version tag such as `0.1.0`; release candidates use tags like `0.1.0-rc.1` and never update `latest`.

### Upgrade

Back up data and config before upgrading:

```bash
tar -czf renewlet-backup-$(date +%F).tgz .env docker-compose.yml data
```

Upgrade to a specific stable image:

```bash
sed -i.bak 's#RENEWLET_IMAGE=.*#RENEWLET_IMAGE="zhiyingzzhou/renewlet:0.1.0"#' .env
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f
```

### Common commands

Check status and logs:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f
```

Stop the service while keeping data:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Common settings live in `.env`:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PORT` | Public port, `3000` by default. |
| `RENEWLET_IMAGE` | Docker image, `zhiyingzzhou/renewlet:latest` by default. |
| `TZ` | Container time zone, mainly for logs; reminders use each user's time zone. |
| `PB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Encryption key for sensitive PocketBase settings. Do not rotate it casually after deployment. |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Bearer secret for external Cron calls to `/api/cron/notifications`. |
| `NOTIFICATION_SCHEDULER_ENABLED` | Enables the built-in notification scheduler. Defaults to `true`. |

The full Docker environment template is in `.env.example`.

## Releases

Renewlet publishes stable versions from GitHub tags such as `v0.1.0`. Each stable release includes Docker Hub and GHCR images plus a `renewlet-docker-vX.Y.Z.zip` deployment package. Release candidates are published as prereleases with `rc` Docker tags and are meant for validation before a stable release.

Development happens on `dev`; `main` represents the latest stable release. Release and hotfix work use `release/vX.Y.Z` and `hotfix/vX.Y.Z` branches. Pull requests and commits should follow Conventional Commits, for example `feat: add notification channel` or `fix: prevent duplicate reminders`.

See [Release Process](docs/release-process.md) for the full workflow.

## Local Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start the backend:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/server start
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
pnpm --filter @renewlet/client dev
```

Local Vite runs at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies `/api` and `/_` to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

Build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Common checks:

```bash
pnpm check:file-lines
pnpm check:deploy
pnpm --filter @renewlet/client typecheck
pnpm --dir packages/server test
pnpm test:all
```
